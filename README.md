## Description

This repository holds interesting "names" extracted from the [gecko source code][1]. It leverages the `*Atoms.py` generator files. All processed files can be found in [data/source][2]. Cleaned versions (containing only the actual "names" are stored in [data/plain][3]).

For Chrome (blink) "names" see [chrome-names][4].
